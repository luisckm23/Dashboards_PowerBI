# Dashboards created with Power BI

This space was created to share with you my journey of learning in the dynamic fields of data visualization and data analysis, 
specifically using the robust tools that Power BI offers. Over time, I've immersed myself in mastering the intricate capabilities of Power BI, 
from its intuitive interface to its powerful data modeling features. This journey has involved exploring the depths of data transformation, 
creating compelling visual narratives, and deriving actionable insights that drive decision-making. By delving into diverse datasets and experimenting with
various visualization techniques, I've gained a profound understanding of how to effectively communicate complex data stories. 
My goal is to not only showcase my progress but also to inspire and guide others who are navigating their own paths in data analytics. Through detailed tutorials, 
practical examples, and thoughtful reflections, I aim to build a community where knowledge is shared, skills are honed, and the power of data is fully harnessed. 
Join me as I continue to explore, learn, and innovate in the ever-evolving landscape of data visualization with Power BI.

### SuperStore 

You can find here my very first Power BI archive, this one is related to a SuperStore, which has sells all around USA and some cities in Canada. The information provided in a
Excel document, was used to create a complete panel dashboard where we can find information associated with level of sells, incomings, cost by each product, where they are selling more, 
and which is their star product. 
All the information reveals important insights for decision-making regarding the future ot this store and I've created useful charts to measure the sellings. Next you can vizualiced some of 
the most important scenarios.

#### SELLINGS
- Total sellings
- Sellings by category
