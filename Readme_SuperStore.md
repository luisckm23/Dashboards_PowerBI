### SuperStore 

You can find here my very first Power BI archive, this one is related to a SuperStore, which has sells all around USA and some cities in Canada. The information provided in a
Excel document, was used to create a complete panel dashboard where we can find information associated with level of sells, incomings, cost by each product, where they are selling more, 
and which is their star product. 
All the information reveals important insights for decision-making regarding the future ot this store and I've created useful charts to measure the sellings. Next you can vizualiced some of 
the most important scenarios.
